## How to Contribute

We manage our project using GitHub Projects. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/orgs/DaleStudy/projects/2). The team holds a weekly meeting to discuss the previous week's progress and plan for the upcoming week.

1. Create ticket(item or draft in Backlog)s together in regular meetings.
2. Assign yourself to a ticket on [the Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/DaleStudy/projects/2/views/2).
3. Convert item to an Issue with click "Convert to issue" button.
4. Create a branch through the Issue.
5. Make a PR after you've pushed your code changes (Don't forget to link your PR to the Issue you created earlier).
6. After a code review and receiving at least one approval, merge the changes into the main branch.
7. The code merged into the main branch will be immediately released through GitHub Pages.
